## Contributing to MapRoulette

There are many different ways to contribute to MapRoulette! We're excited you are looking to help out. There are many ways to do so!

### I found something that is broken while using MapRoulette

Please tell us about it!

First, please search for keywords that may be relevant. For example, if your problem has to do with GeoJSON, a [search](https://github.com/maproulette/maproulette3/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20geojson) for that term will uncover some existing, open issues. If your problem is already covered, please consider adding a comment if it adds to the discussion (not just a üëç / üëé / `+1`).

If you didn't find anything that describes your problem, please [open a new issue](https://github.com/maproulette/maproulette3/issues/new/choose). Please fill out as much detail as possible, that will help us hopefully isolate and reproduce the problem quickly and do something about it.

Please do not be discouraged or angry if someone does not respond to you straight away. MapRoulette is a big project that is run by a very small team.

### I have an idea for a feature to include in MapRoulette

That is fantastic! The best way to discuss new ideas is to [join the OpenStreetMap U.S. Slack](https://slack.openstreetmap.us/) if you're not already a member, and discuss it in the `#maproulette` channel.

[You can also submit your idea here](https://github.com/maproulette/maproulette3/issues/new/choose). Please describe it in as much detail as possible and also try to explain why you think your idea would be a great addition to MapRoulette.

There are other places where the OSM Community talk to one another, such as the OSM Community Forums, Discord, Facebook, Matrix, Telegram channels, and many more. It is impossible for us to keep track of all the conversations happening in those channels. You are of course free to talk about MapRoulette anywhere, but if you want us to learn about your feedback (and we do want to!), please use the methods listed here.

### I want to help translate MapRoulette or the documentation

We would love your help! We use Transifex as a translation platform. Using Transifex is pretty intuitive and no technical expertise is required. Head over to the [Transifex site for MapRoulette](https://www.transifex.com/osmlab/maproulette3/) or [the site for the MapRoulette documentation](https://app.transifex.com/maproulette/mr-docs). Chances are that someone has alreade started work on your language. We already have more than 20 language communities!

### I want to help others use MapRoulette

The community can definitely use your MapRoulette exptertise! There are many ways you can help make MapRoulette accessible to more people:

- Contribute to the [MapRoulette documentation](https://learn.maproulette.org), which has [its own repository](https://github.com/maproulette/docs).
- Join the `#maproulette` Slack Channel on the [OpenStreetMap U.S. Slack](https://slack.openstreetmap.us/), where MapRoulette users like you ask and answer questions.
- Run a Workshop, a class, or host a presentation. We have a lot of resources you are welcome to use. Please get in touch for help!

### I am a programmer and want to contribute to the MapRoulette code.

We would love your help working on the future of MapRoulette. The MapRoulette application consists of two main parts:

1. The web application code, written in react, [lives here](https://github.com/maproulette/maproulette3).
2. The backend and API, written in Scala / Play, [lives here](https://github.com/maproulette/maproulette-backend)

Feel free to explore [any of the other public repositories in the MapRoulette Github organization](https://github.com/maproulette) as well!

We have a [guide](DEVELOPMENT.md) to help you get set up. There are usually a few tickets marked as [good first issue](https://github.com/maproulette/maproulette3/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20label%3A%22good%20first%20issue%22).

### Are there any project meetings I can join?

Yes! Please join our monthly Community Meetings, usually on the second Tuesday of every month. [Consult the OSM events calendar](https://osmcal.org/) to learn about the next meeting. We would love to have you!

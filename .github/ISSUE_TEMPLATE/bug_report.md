* If you would like to report a Challenge you think is causing bad edits to OSM, please raise the issue with the Challenge owner first using the *Get In Touch* feature on the Challenge home page. If they fail to respond, please post to the [OSM community forum](https://community.openstreetmap.org) with the hashtag **#maproulette**.
* There is a [separate repository for the MapRoulette back end](https://github.com/maproulette/maproulette-backend/issues). If your report pertains to the API / back end, please submit it there.

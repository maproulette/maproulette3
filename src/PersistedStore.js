/**
 * initializePersistedStore sets up the redux store in combination with
 * redux-persist so that it'll be persisted to local storage. The redux store
 * is initially hydrated from local storage when the application is fired up on
 * subsequent sessions, and the given callback will be invoked after hydration
 * is complete.
 *
 * Data migrations are included for migrating existing persisted stores to new
 * versions of the data model, when feasible, so that the data need not be
 * discarded each time the data model is updated.
 *
 * @param {function} callback - invoked after hydration is complete

 * Drop backend cluster markers whose bubbles would visibly overlap, folding the
 * count of each dropped marker into the one that displaced it.
 *
 * The backend keeps its own markers a minimum distance apart, but it clusters
 * one MVT tile at a time and so never compares a marker against those of the
 * neighbouring tile. Two markers a few pixels either side of a tile boundary are
 * the result -- one bubble drawn over another, its label hidden by MapLibre's
 * own symbol collision. Here every loaded tile's markers are in one list with
 * the map's zoom known, which is the first point where that pair can be seen at
 * all.
 *
 * Markers are considered biggest-count first, so the bubble a reader would
 * notice missing is the one that survives, and a marker is kept only when it
 * clears every already-kept bubble by DECLUTTER_GAP_PX. Overlap is judged
 * against the radii the layer actually draws, so small bubbles may sit closer
 * together than large ones instead of every pair paying the worst case. A
 * dropped marker's tasks are added to the nearest survivor -- positions never
 * move, so absorbing a neighbour cannot push a bubble into another one -- and
 * the counts on screen still add up to the tasks in view.
 *
 * `zoom` is the map's live fractional zoom: at zoom 9.8 a z=9 tile is drawn at
 * 1.7x, and markers that overlapped at 1x no longer do.

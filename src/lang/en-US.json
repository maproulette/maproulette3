It\ndoes not work on the live OSM database, but the data you get from Overpass is\nusually just a few minutes old. Using\n[Overpass QL](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Overpass_API/Language_Guide),\nthe Overpass Query Language, you can define exactly which OSM objects you want\nto load into your Challenge as Tasks.\n[Learn more](https://github.com/maproulette/maproulette2/wiki/Introducing-New-MapRoulette---Part-1.-Creating-and-Maintaining-Challenges#via-overpass).\n\n#### Via Local GeoJSON File\n\nThe other option is to use a GeoJSON file you already have. This could be great\nif you have an approved source of external data you would like to manually add\nto OSM. Tools like\n[QGIS](https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/91812/convert-shapefiles-to-geojson)\nand [gdal](http://www.gdal.org/drv_geojson.html) can convert things like\nShapefiles to GeoJSON.  When you convert, make sure that you use unprojected\nlon/lat on the WGS84 datum (EPSG:4326), because this is what MapRoulette uses\ninternally.\n\n> Note: for challenges with a large number of tasks, we recommend using a\n[line-by-line](https://github.com/osmlab/maproulette3/wiki/Line-by-Line-GeoJSON-Format)\nformat instead, which is much less memory-intensive to process.\n\n#### Via Remote GeoJSON URL\n\nThe only difference between using a local GeoJSON file and a URL is where you\ntell MapRoulette to get it from. If you use a URL, make sure you point to the\nraw GeoJSON file, not a page that contains a link to the file, or MapRoulette\nwill not be able to make sense of it.",

/**
 *
 * genericEntityReducer returns a function suitable for reducing normalized
 * entity data retrieved from the server. It limits itself to processing of the
 * given actionTypes and entityName, even if the normalized response contains
 * multiple types of entities. If additional reduction is required for the
 * entity, pass in a reduceFurther function: it will be invoked with the
 * mergedState, originalState, and array of entity objects to be further
 * reduced.
 *
 * > Note that only matching actions with status RequestStatus.success will be
 * > reduced; others will be ignored.
 *
 * Internally, this reducer is performing a simple lodash merge of the old and
 * new entity data. While this will work fine in many cases, it may not always
 * produce the desired result. For example, old arrays will be merged with new
 * ones rather than replaced by them, producing a union of old and new values.
 * In some cases these specific flaws can be addressed with a reduceFurther
 * function (which, in our example, could overwrite the old child array with
 * the new one if replacement was desired).
 *
 * @see See [lodash merge](https://lodash.com/docs#merge)
 *
 * @param {(string|string[])} actionTypes - one or more action types to reduce
 * @param {string} entityName - the name of the target entity to reduce
 * @param {function} [reduceFurther] - optional function that will be invoked
 *        with mergedState, originalState, entities for further reduction
 *        of the entities.
 *
 * @returns {function} a function that can be used as a redux reducer.

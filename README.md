# MapRoulette ðŸŽ°

MapRoulette is where OpenStreetMap mappers go to find meaningful, small mapping tasks to complete. The live website is at [maproulette.org](https://maproulette.org).

Some of the things you can do with MapRoulette:

- Solve some tasks to make the map better
- Create tasks yourself for your fellow OSM community mappers to solve
- Create elaborate OSM QA workflows for your organization, including task review and progress metrics
- Use the MapRoulette API to integrate MapRoulette tasks into your own application

MapRoulette is an OpenStreetMap U.S. [Charter Project](https://openstreetmap.us/our-work/charter-projects/maproulette/).

## Using MapRoulette

If you're looking to improve OSM using MapRoulette, you can get started at [maproulette.org](https://maproulette.org) right away. You can log in to MapRoulette with your existing OSM account. If you don't have an OSM account, you probably want to learn the basics of mapping with OSM first. The best way to do this is to [create your very own OSM account](https://www.openstreetmap.org/user/new), move the map to your home town, and click "Edit" on the OSM web site. The OSM web editor has a built in walk-though that teaches you the basics. Once you have mastered basic OSM editing, you can use your new OSM account to log on to MapRoulette and start finding some easy tasks!

All documentation for MapRoulette is at [learn.maproulette.org](https://learn.maproulette.org/). This site has resources for both mappers and those interested in developing their own MapRoulette Challenges.

## Donating

MapRoulette is a core part of OpenStreetMap QA infrastructure, relied upon by thousands of community members, many of whom use MapRoulette daily. Ongoing maintenance and development of MapRoulette is entirely reliant on in-kind and financial support. If you're interested in supporting MapRoulette by making a financial contribution or commit developer resources to the project, please contact OpenStreetMap US by emailing team@openstreetmap.us.
